# CS2_HW10

You will do this homework in teams of 3-4 students.  Try to pick students you have not worked with before.

## Introduction
Another interesting type of graph is one with parallel edges.  For example, this graph:

parallel-edges.png

There are two edges between nodes A and C with two different weights.  Such graphs can be useful for some problems.  But they are more difficult to represent.  So, this is the job of your team, figure out a way to represent a graph with parallel edges.

Note, your mechanism should represent the parallel edges in some way so that you can quickly find ALL of the edges between any two vertices.

Note, you can find my code from class to implement an Adjacency List graph under Week 10.

## What to Submit
Submit your solution as a code file. Give the file the name AssignmentTypeNumberLastNameFirstName.cpp (so, for example, my submission for Homework 3 would be named Homework3MaclinRichard.txt). You should also include your first and last name in the file and the names of your teammates. Your code does not have to run, but you may consider testing your code to demonstrate that your solution is correct.
